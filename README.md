# 🌿 Cozy-Zen

A personal collection of custom CSS tweaks to make [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/) feel calm, cozy, and perfectly tailored to my workflow.

Zen Browser supports deep UI customization through `userChrome.css`—and this repo is where I experiment, refine, and share my favorite visual enhancements.

## 🎨 Features
- Streamlined interface with reduced visual clutter  
- Soft padding and rounded elements for a “cozy” feel  
- Custom tab styling (vertical or horizontal)  
- Subtle animations and hover effects  
- Optimized for focus and minimal distraction  

> 💡 Inspired by minimalism and mindful computing.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. **Locate your Zen Browser profile folder**  
   Go to `about:support` → **Profile Folder** → **Open Directory**.

2. **Enable custom CSS**  
   In Zen Browser, go to `about:config` and enable:  toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets = true

3. **Install this theme**  
- Inside your profile folder, create a `chrome` folder (if it doesn’t exist).  
- Place the `userChrome.css` file from this repo into that folder.  
- Restart Zen Browser.

Your browser UI should now reflect the Cozy-Zen style!
